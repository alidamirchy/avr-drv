== Prebuild package ==

You should grab the package in the download section and extract it in /opt/avr-drv

== Building from source ==

Well, lets face it, this is not the easiest thing, but it is for sure not hard. Machine used to build release is as follow:
  * Ubuntu 10.04 x64
  * avr-libc 1.7.0

You will need:
  * avr-drv source
  * XML description part from AVR Studio version 4.18 build 700
  * a rabbit leg

Assuming that avr-drc sources are in /home/user/avr-drv
  * Place xml in xmlPartDescription directory
  * Patch avr-libc headers
  * Patch XML files
  * Run make.sh
  * Result is placed in avr-drv directory, you can copy it to /opt/
