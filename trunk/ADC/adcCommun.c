/*! \file adcCommun.c
 \brief This file contains common code for ADC.

 This file contains common function for all supported ADC.
 This file may eventually get modified as more AVR device get supported.

 Currently only use the following register:
 \li \c ADMUX
 \li \c ADCSRA
 \li \c ADCW
 \li \c ADCH
 \li \c ADCL
